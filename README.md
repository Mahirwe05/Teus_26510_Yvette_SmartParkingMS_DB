## Smart Parking Management System – Process Description 

This diagram shows how the Smart Parking Management System works, with three main parts: 

 Customer (Driver) 

 Reservation System 

 Payment Processor 

The process starts when a customer creates an account. They can either cancel or log in. After logging in, the customer searches for available parking spaces in a certain area. This request goes to the Reservation System, which checks if a slot is available. 

 

## If a parking lot is available, the system: 


- ✅ **Validates the space**
- 🔄 **Updates the reservation status**
- ✉️ **Sends a confirmation message to the customer**
- 💬 **Asks the customer to make a payment**

### ❌ If the slot is **not available**:
- 📭 Sends an **unavailability message**
- 🚫 Declines the customer’s request

---

## 💳 Payment Flow

- When the customer proceeds to payment, they can choose:
  - 💳 **Card**
  - 📱 **Mobile Money (MoMo)**

- The **Payment Processor** handles the transaction.
  - ✅ If successful:
    - 💸 Account is debited
    - 📢 System confirms the parking is ready
    - 🚗 Customer can now park their car

---

## 🧠 How This Supports MIS (Management Information Systems)

- 🧭 **Makes decisions easier** – real-time updates help the system and users know what to do next  
- ⏱ **Saves time** – faster than manual processes  
- 🔗 **Connects data** – customer info, availability, and payments all in one place  
- 📊 **Supports future planning** – system collects data for reports and improvements  

---

## 🌟 Why This Process Is Important

- 🅿️ **Efficient use of parking spaces**  
- 🚦 **Reduces traffic and waiting times**  
- 💰 **Increases earnings by avoiding unused spaces**  
- 😀 **Enhances the customer experience**

> 💡 **Overall**, it makes managing public parking **smarter, faster, and more effective.**
